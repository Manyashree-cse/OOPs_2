# OOPs_2
day 2 internship

This project is a simple Python program that simulates basic Instagram Reel features using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates how to create a class with attributes like title, description, creator name, location, likes, and comments, and how to manipulate them using class methods.

The program allows users to like or dislike a reel, add and delete comments, and display reel details. This project is ideal for beginners to understand core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, constructors (__init__), instance variables, and methods in Python.
